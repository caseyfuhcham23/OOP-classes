## Project Description
This repository showcases my work on the "Object-Oriented Programming" project (course code 420-CT2-AS) under the guidance of Professor Maftei Mihai. The project was completed as part of my coursework for the Winter 2023 session.

## Overview
The project aimed to develop a set of Windows Forms applications using C# that demonstrate competencies in object-oriented development. It included seven distinct forms, each with its unique functionality. Here's a brief overview of the project:

Dashboard (Form 0): A central hub that provides access to various form applications. It includes an exit confirmation, identification, and a short description of the project.

Lotto Max and 649 Applications (Form 1 & 2): These forms generate random unique numbers for the Lotto Max and Lotto 649 lotteries. The generated numbers are saved to a text file along with relevant information.

Money Exchange Application (Form 3): This application allows currency conversion using exchange rates. It can handle multiple currencies and saves conversion details to a text file.

Temperature Conversion Application (Form 4): This form provides options for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It includes color-coded temperature categories and file operations for saving and retrieving conversions.

Simple Calculator (Form 5): A basic calculator application that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It tracks user time and records arithmetic operations to a text file.

IP4 Validator Application (Form 6): This form validates and stores valid IP4 addresses to a binary file. It also calculates and displays the time spent on the form.

## Project Highlights
